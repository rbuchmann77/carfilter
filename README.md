### What is this repository for? ###

This application is a POC (Proof of Concept) of a car filter: monitor particulate matter (PM25) to enable/disable a fan in a car.
For **Arduino** and **Grove sensor**

I tried my detector in my car and found:
- High level of PM around some crop fields
- Low level of PM around periurban roads around Paris
- "high level" of PM at some rare traffic light.

### How do I get set up? ###

You will need:
- grove dust sensor: https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Dust-Sensor-PPD42NS.html.
- arduino kit, with display "LiquidCrystal"

### What's next? ###

Some ideas/personal questions:

- modern cars have filter for PM25
- some commercial products are more cheaper than homemade prototypes (or equal).
